1.Comment on the results.
We could see from the output that different thresholds keep different features of the original image. The Adaptive and 
BinaryThreshold filtering keep more same features of the original image and Threshold as well as SemiThreshold keep less.

2.What are the disadvantages of binary threshold?
The BinaryThreshold will highlight part of the features but ignore the others. For example, in dealing with the Lenna picture,
it highlights her face and ignore the background. It will be useful when we want to highligh some parts in an image, but it will
ignore many details.

3.When is Adaptive Threshold useful?
The adaptive threshold will be useful when we want to perform multiple processes on the same page at different levels. It is 
because is allows us to apply multiple thresholds at the same time.
